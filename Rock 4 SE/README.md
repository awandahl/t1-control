### T1 control Rock 4 SE  
#### This is a fully working script where the fq of my QRP Labs QDX/QMX can control the band memory setting on the Elecraft T1 automatic tuner. Any transceiver using rigctld can be used of course...


Rock 4 SE specific information:  
GPIO numbers like 18 and 22 are derived from an offset calculation based on the GPIO bank and pin. For instance, GPIO4_C2 means:  

GPIO bank 4, port C (where C represents an offset of 2, starting from A as 0).
Each bank has 32 pins (A-D).
The formula is: GPIO number = Bank * 32 + Port offset * 8 + Pin number.
For example:

GPIO4_C2 = 4 * 32 + 2 = 18
GPIO4_C6 = 4 * 32 + 6 = 22.

You can refer to this GPIO wiki for more details.
