### T1 control by Rock 4 SE  

The Rock 4 SE, like other Rock 4 series boards, uses a different GPIO numbering system compared to the Raspberry Pi. This is due to the different SoC (System on Chip) used in these boards.
For the Rock 4 SE:  
1. GPIO numbering is based on the RK3399 chip's GPIO banks and pins within those banks.  
2. The formula to calculate the GPIO number is:  
3. GPIO number = (bank number * 32) + (group number * 8) + pin number  
For example, GPIO4_C2 (physical pin 11) is calculated as:  
4 * 32 + 2 * 8 + 2 = 146
    
There isn't a direct way to use physical pin numbers in the Rock 4 SE's GPIO system like you can with the Raspberry Pi. You need to use the calculated GPIO numbers or the GPIO bank and pin designations (like GPIO4_C2).
